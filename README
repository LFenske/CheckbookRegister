What it is
==========
Checkbook Register is a web-based application to help manage a
checkbook register by automating many checkbook register processes.
See my final report for the Coursera Web Development Capstone Project from 2016-06-12.

Prerequisites
=============
nodejs nodejs-legacy
npm
mongodb
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ npm install -g bower

Installation
============
$ git clone https://github.com/LFenske/CheckbookRegister.git
$ cd CheckbookRegister   (the directory with this README and a Makefile)
$ make setup

Configuration
=============
If you want your MongoDB server to run elsewhere, configure the
MongoDB host and port in loopback/server/datasources.json, start it
yourself, and skip "make mongod" below.

Change the definition of baseURL in app/js/services.js to reflect the
host of your NodeJS server.  A reasonable value is
'http://localhost:3000/api'.  If it's somewhere else, start it
yourself and skip "make server" below.

Running
=======
window 1: make mongod
Wait for server to start.
window 2: make server
Wait for server to start.
window 3: make grunt

Browse to the location of your server, port 9000,
e.g. http://towanda.dsl.frii.com:9000 or http://localhost:9000.
